## Install

Composer Create-Project enables you to create a new project based on creiwork. Composer will install Creiwork and all of it's server-side dependencies.

```sh
composer create-project creios/creiwork my-new-project
```

Creiwork uses yar to install client-side dependencies.

```sh
yarn

Creiwork uses the directory ```cache``` to store often uses values. This directory needs permissions to be written by the webserver process. 

```sh
chown www-data:www-data cache 
```
